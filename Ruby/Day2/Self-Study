Q. Find out how to access files with and without code blocks. What is the benefit of the code block?
A. File.open and File.new are roughly equiv'   Open offers the block which doesn't return the file handle - it closes the file, thus eliminating the need for you to manage that.  (unless you wanted to leave it open, of course.)

Q. How would you translate a hash to an array? Can you translate arrays to hashes?
A. Hash.to_a ( or you could use Hash.shift -but it's destructive - or Hash.sort)
From Array to Hash might work as Hash[*myarray.flatten]  (see: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/39567/what-is-the-best-way-to-convert-an-array-to-a-hash-in-ruby )

Q. Can you iterate through a hash?
A. Yes - for instance:
myHash.each {|key,value| print key, " is ",value, "\n"}

Q. You can use Ruby arrays as stacks. What other common data structures do arrays support?
A. Kinda supports Set (via uniq), but there's a Set specific class for that.
